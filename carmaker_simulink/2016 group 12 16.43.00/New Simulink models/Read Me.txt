"DPC_intersection" is the current CarMaker project folder and contains the newest models that I have developed during the spring.


It contains 4 different models of interest:

DPC_model_mpcqpsolver.slx
DPC_model_quadprog.slx
DPC_model_quadprog_v2.slx
DPC_model_quadprog_v2_old_const.slx


Unfortunately the mpcqpsolver didnt work well for this huge optimization problem. 

Therfore did I stick with quadprog in the latter models. 

"DPC_model_quadprog_v2.slx " have a better and more correct implementation of the rate contraint. 

"DPC_model_quadprog_v2_old_const.slx" use the old rate constraints.


The models are completly different from the design project course:

1: It makes use of matrices instead of structs.
2: The MPC block runs with 50 ms sample time
3: The discretization is adjustable (default 4m)
4: The IPG driver is disconected in order to get rid of the brake intervention when leaving the control zone.
5: The Dynamic Car have a constant speed before and after the intersection.
6: The PID parameters in the AccelCtrl bock are adjusted.

 
Run the init script "Init_script.m" in src_cm4sl folder in order to run a simulation.
And use the test run: "DPC_final".
